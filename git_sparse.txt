Here are simple steps with sparse checkout approach which will populate the
working directory sparsely, so you can tell Git which folder(s) or file(s) in
the working directory are worth checking out.

    Clone repository as usual (--no-checkout is optional):

    git clone --no-checkout git@foo/bar.git
    cd bar

    You may skip this step, if you've your repository already cloned.

    Hint: For large repos, consider shallow clone (--depth 1) to checkout only
latest revision or/and --single-branch only.

    Enable sparseCheckout option:

    git config core.sparseCheckout true

    Specify folder(s) for sparse checkout (without space at the end):

    echo "trunk/public_html/*"> .git/info/sparse-checkout

    or edit .git/info/sparse-checkout.

    Checkout the branch (e.g. master):

    git checkout master

Now you should have selected folders in your current directory.
